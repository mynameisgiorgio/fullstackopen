title Exercise 0.6

note over Browser
document.getElementById('notes_form') instructs the code 
to fetch the form-element from the page, and
to register an event handler to handle the form submit event.
end note 

note over Browser
The event handler immediately calls the method
e.preventDefault() to prevent the defaulthandling of form submit.
end note 

note over Browser
Then the event handler creates a new note,
adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note),
rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
end note
